Here i will take my notes:

Client-Server model client(request)- Server(response)
The client starts the communication and the server always listens, then generate the data and a response.
If there is no client it is not a problem, the server waits until there is a client, but the other way around
if there is not server, there is a problem, so make sure that you run the server and ckeck that it is connected.

These programs are running inside a computer/phone/tablet or any device with a microprocessor.
Inside a computer there are a lot of programs not just 1. You can run the client and the server in the same
computer. Client and server they connect with each other with the internet. There are many compiuters
connected in networks (network interface).
For sending something to the server we have to identify the machine and that is called IP address. 1 machine
can have more than 1 IP address depending on how many machines is connected to. IP is not like an identification.
* write ifconfig in the terminal to see what is the IP of our computer
* ping "IP"
URC to identify
If in the same computer there are 2 or more serves we have to say the IP address and the port number of the server
even if there is only 1 server you have to give always 2 numbers to conect with the server (IP and port)



My phone IP address at URJC is 10.0.54.160
Teacher's IP address at URJC is 212.128.253.64
My computer IP address at URJC is 212.128.253.98

* ping time to 8.8.8.8: time=3.49 ms

* ping time to my computer: time=0.061 ms

*ping time to a computer in the same network (212.128. 253.99): time=0.594 ms

*ping time to my phone: time=8.62 ms

*ping time to the teacher's computer: time=0.588 ms

*ping to github.com (140.82.118.3): time=29.2 ms

*ping to urjc.es (212.128.240.50): time=2.08 ms
